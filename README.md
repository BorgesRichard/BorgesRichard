# Richard Borges
### Software Engineer | System Architect | Minimalist Coder

> "I write software the way some people draw lines: **clean, measured, and only when necessary.**"
I'm a developer who values **clarity, intention and the quiet elegance of well-structured systems**. I believe in code that ages gracefully, interfaces that feel deliberate, and architectures that stay honest under pressure.
