### Software Engineer | System Architect | Minimalist Coder

> "I write software the way some people draw lines: **clean, measured, and only when necessary.**"

I'm a developer who values **clarity, intention and the quiet elegance of well-structured systems**. I believe in code that ages gracefully, interfaces that feel deliberate, and architectures that stay honest under pressure.

## ✨ Engineering Philosophy
My work is driven by a commitment to **long-term maintainability** and carefully crafted interfaces, emphasising three core principles:

* **Clarity:** Systems must be immediately comprehensible and documented by design.
* **Stability:** Architectures built to endure change and external pressures.
* **Precision:** Rigorous implementation and a deep appreciation for **predictable state** and **composable abstractions**.
